# Development Server Management

## User Preference

The user typically keeps a development server (`npm run dev`) running in the background during development sessions.

## Guidelines

- **Do NOT start additional dev server instances** unless explicitly requested
- Before running `npm run dev`, check if there are any indications that a server might already be running
- When testing changes, prefer using the existing running server rather than starting a new one
- If you need to verify functionality, suggest the user check their existing dev server or ask them to restart it if needed
- Only start background dev servers when:
  - User explicitly requests it
  - It's the first time setting up the project
  - There are clear indications no server is currently running

## Debugging Approach

- Use build commands (`npm run build`) to check for compilation errors
- Use static analysis and type checking rather than starting servers
- If server testing is needed, mention that the user should check their existing dev server

This avoids port conflicts and unnecessary resource usage while maintaining efficient development workflow.
